A TUI library for C++

---

Note: This library consists of two main parts:
- A **C++** style, RAII, OOP style wrapper around *ncurses* so we can take advantage of **C++**'s
resource management and object oriented facilities.
- New functionality to add some nice things to your TUI applications (i.e. different kind of boxes,
animated typing, etc).

All of it is (mainly) built on top of *ncurses*.
